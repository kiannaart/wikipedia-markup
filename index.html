    <h2>Classification</h2>

    <p>
      In 
      musicology, 
      string instruments are known as chordophones. It is one of the five main divisions of instruments in the Hornbostel–Sachs 
      scheme of 
      musical instrument classification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curt Sachs also broke chordophones into four basic subcategories, "zithers, lutes, lyres and harps."

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zither" title="Zithers">Zithers</a> 
          include 
          <i>stick zithers</i> 
          such as the musical bow, <i>tube zithers</i>
          with a tube as the resonator such as the valiha, raft zithers in which tube zithers are tied into a single "raft", 
          <i>board zithers</i> 
          including clavichord and piano and dulcimer, and long zithers (described as combination of half-tube and board zithers) including Se and Guzheng families.

          Lutes are stringed musical instruments that include a body and "a neck which serves both as a handle and as a means of stretching the strings beyond the body."[3] The lute family includes not only short-necked plucked lutes such as the lute, oud, pipa, guitar, citole, gittern, mandore, rubab, and gambus and long-necked plucked lutes such as the tanbura, swarabat, bağlama, bouzouki, veena, theorbo, archlute, pandura, sitar, setar, but also bowed instruments such as the Yaylı tambur, rebab, erhu, and entire family of viols and violins.[3]

          The lyre has two arms, which have a "yoke" or crossbar connecting them, and strings between the crossbar and the soundboard.[2] Sachs divided this into the box lyre such as the Greek kithara and the bowl lyre which used a bowl on its side with skin soundboard.[2]
        </li>

        <li>The harp which has strings vertical to the soundboard.[2]
